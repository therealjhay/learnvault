# Introduction to Stellar & the Stellar Network

Stellar is an open-source, decentralized network that connects the world's financial infrastructure. It is designed to allow money to be moved and stored quickly, reliably, and at almost no cost.

## What makes Stellar unique?

Unlike many other blockchains, Stellar's primary focus is on **financial inclusion** and the **tokenization of real-world assets**. It achieves this through several core primitives built directly into the protocol.

### Key Concepts

1.  **Assets**: Anything of value can be issued on Stellar. From national currencies (CBDCs and stablecoins) to gold, real estate, or even loyalty points.
2.  **Accounts**: Every user on Stellar has an account identified by a Public Key (G...) and secured by a Secret Seed (S...).
3.  **The Ledger**: A shared, distributed database of every transaction that has ever occurred on the network.
4.  **Trustlines**: To hold an asset other than XLM (the native currency), an account must "trust" the issuer of that asset. This prevents spam and ensures you only receive assets you want.

## Enter Soroban: Smart Contracts on Stellar

Soroban is Stellar's smart contract platform, designed for performance, scalability, and developer-friendliness. It uses WebAssembly (Wasm) and is built to integrate seamlessly with Stellar's existing asset ecosystem.

With Soroban, you can build complex protocols like:
- **DeFi**: Automated Market Makers (AMMs), lending protocols, and derivatives.
- **DAO Governance**: Voting and treasury management.
- **Interoperability**: Bridges and cross-chain communication.

## Learning Objectives for this Track

In this track, you will:
1.  Set up your first Stellar wallet.
2.  Fund your account using the Friendbot on the Testnet.
3.  Perform your first on-chain transaction.
4.  Learn the basics of Soroban contract development.
