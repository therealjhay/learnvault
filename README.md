## Introduction

**LearnVault** is a decentralized learn-and-earn platform where education meets
opportunity. Learners earn reputation tokens by completing skill tracks, while
donors and sponsors fund a community treasury governed by DAO voting. The best
learners get funded to go further — no gatekeepers, no bureaucracy, just proof
of effort and community belief.

LearnVault is designed specifically with African learners in mind — a generation
of ambitious builders who have the talent and drive but lack access to the
financial resources that would take their skills to the next level. By combining
blockchain-powered credentials, on-chain reputation, and decentralized
scholarship funding, LearnVault creates a self-sustaining education ecosystem
that rewards effort and amplifies potential.

---

## Problem Statement

Access to quality tech education across Africa is not limited by lack of
ambition — it is limited by lack of opportunity. Three core problems define the
gap:

**Funding Barriers** — Bootcamps, courses, and developer tools cost money that
most learners in emerging markets simply do not have. Scholarship systems that
exist are slow, opaque, and often inaccessible.

**Credential Trust Gap** — Traditional certificates are easy to fake and hard to
verify. Employers and DAOs have no reliable way to assess a candidate's real
on-chain track record.

**Broken Incentive Systems** — Existing learn-to-earn platforms flood learners
with worthless tokens for clicking through slides. There is no real connection
between learning effort and financial reward.

LearnVault addresses all three problems in a single, cohesive platform.

---

## Solution

LearnVault creates a three-pillar ecosystem:

**1. Learn** — Learners enroll in skill tracks covering Web3 development, smart
contract engineering, DeFi, frontend development, and more. Every verified
milestone they complete earns them LearnTokens — soulbound, non-transferable
reputation tokens that live on-chain.

**2. Earn** — LearnTokens are proof of real effort. They unlock governance
rights, scholarship eligibility, and platform reputation. High-achieving
learners convert a portion of their LearnTokens into Governance Tokens, giving
them a voice in the DAO.

**3. Get Funded** — Learners with sufficient on-chain reputation can submit
scholarship proposals to the community treasury. Governance token holders vote
on proposals. Approved scholars receive milestone-based disbursements in
stablecoins — real, stable value delivered directly to their wallets.

## Smart Contract System

LearnVault is powered by six core smart contracts:

### `learn_token`

A **soulbound SEP-41 fungible token** that is minted to learners upon verified
milestone completion. Non-transferable by design — it represents real effort,
not speculation. Your LearnToken balance is your on-chain academic reputation
score.

### `governance_token`

A **transferable SEP-41 fungible token** distributed to donors upon treasury
contribution and earned by top learners at milestone thresholds. Used
exclusively for DAO voting on scholarship proposals.

### `course_milestone`

Tracks learner progress per course. Each course has defined checkpoints verified
by a trusted multi-sig validator (transitioning to oracle-based verification in
V2). On successful verification, this contract triggers LearnToken minting.

### `scholarship_treasury`

Holds all donor funds in stablecoins (USDC). Funds can only be released upon
successful proposal execution through the governance system. Tracks total
contributions per donor. Transparent and auditable by anyone.

### `milestone_escrow`

Manages approved scholarship disbursements in tranches. Funds are released as
scholars hit agreed milestones. If a scholar is inactive for 30 days, unspent
funds automatically return to the treasury.

### `scholar_nft`

Mints a **soulbound SEP-41 NFT credential** to scholars who complete their
funded programs. Non-transferable, tamper-proof, and permanently verifiable
on-chain. Shareable with employers, DAOs, and the broader ecosystem.

## The Earn Loop

LearnVault's flywheel is designed so that effort compounds over time:

````
Complete Lesson
       │
       ▼
Earn LearnTokens (LRN)
       │
       ▼
Complete Full Track ──▶ Convert LRN to Governance Tokens
       │
       ▼
Submit Scholarship Proposal
       │
      3. **Friendbot Funding (Testnet Only):**
   ```bash
   # Fund your deployer address for testing
   stellar friendbot fund <NETWORK> <ADDRESS>

   # Example:
   stellar friendbot fund testnet GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
````

**Deployer Address:**

- For testing on Stellar Testnet, use the friendbot-funded deployer:
  `GDU2P3YJ5K7E6ZK3Q2K7E6ZK3Q2K7E6ZK3Q2K7E6ZK3` │ ▼ Mint ScholarNFT Credential │
  ▼ Higher Reputation ──▶ Larger Future Proposals ──▶ Loop Continues

````

The more you learn, the more power and opportunity you unlock. Wealth is not the
barrier — effort is the currency.

## Scholarship DAO

The Scholarship DAO is the heart of LearnVault's funding mechanism.

### Eligibility to Apply

A learner must hold a minimum LearnToken balance (set by governance) before
submitting a proposal. This ensures only learners with a verified track record
can access treasury funds.

### Proposal Contents

Each scholarship proposal includes:

- Learning goal and intended program or bootcamp
- Amount requested in USDC
- Timeline and milestone plan
- On-chain reputation score (LRN balance)
- Wallet address for disbursement

### Voting

Governance token holders vote YES or NO within a 7-day window. A proposal passes
if it meets the required quorum and approval threshold. Failed proposals can be
resubmitted after 30 days.

### Disbursement

Approved funds are locked in `milestone_escrow` and released in tranches as
the scholar completes agreed milestones. Progress is reported by the scholar and
confirmed by a community-elected validator committee (transitioning to oracle
verification in V2).

### Accountability

Scholars who abandon funded programs without communication are flagged on-chain.
Repeated abandonment affects future proposal eligibility. Unspent funds always
return to the treasury.

---

## Governance

LearnVault's DAO governance covers:

- Scholarship eligibility thresholds (minimum LRN to apply)
- Voting quorum and approval thresholds
- Treasury allocation limits per proposal
- Adding new course tracks to the platform
- Protocol upgrades and parameter changes

Governance evolves over time. In V1, the founding team holds a multi-sig with
community governance as an advisory layer. In V2, full on-chain governance
transfers to token holders.

## Whitepaper Generation

The LearnVault Technical Whitepaper is authored in Markdown and exported to PDF.
To ensure Mermaid diagrams render correctly in the PDF export, follow this
two-step build process:

1. **Compile Diagrams to Images:** Generate static PNGs from the Mermaid source
   files using the Mermaid CLI:

   ```bash
   npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i docs/architecture.mmd -o docs/architecture.png
````

2. **Generate the PDF:** Once the diagrams are compiled and embedded as standard
   markdown image links, generate the final PDF using `md-to-pdf`:
   ```bash
   npx md-to-pdf docs/whitepaper.md
   ```

````

---

## Setup

1. Install dependencies for the frontend and server:

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd server && npm install
   ```

2. Copy the environment templates before starting local services:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   ```

3. Fill in deployed contract IDs, Pinata credentials, and any server secrets you
   need for your local workflow.

---

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Rust and Stellar CLI:**
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   npm install -g @stellar/stellar-cli
````

2. **Install Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows):**

   ```bash
   # Download Visual Studio Build Tools installer
   # Visit: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
   # Or use winget: wing install VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**

   ```bash
   # Copy the root environment template
   cp .env.example .env

   # Copy the server environment template
   cp server/.env.example server/.env

   # Edit .env with your configuration
   # Set STELLAR_SCAFFOLD_ENV=testnet for testnet deployment
   ```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test                 # runs all Soroban contract tests
npm run test:contracts   # alias for the above
npm run test:watch       # re-runs tests on file changes
```

### Lint and Format Contracts

Before submitting a PR, ensure Rust contracts pass formatting and lint checks:

```bash
cargo fmt --all               # auto-format all contracts
cargo fmt --all -- --check    # check formatting without modifying files (used in CI)
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings  # lint all contracts (warnings are errors)
```

Formatting rules are defined in `.rustfmt.toml` at the repo root
(`edition = "2024"`, `max_width = 100`).
