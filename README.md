## Introduction

**LearnVault** is a decentralized learn-and-earn platform where education meets
opportunity. Learners earn reputation tokens by completing skill tracks, while
donors and sponsors fund a community treasury governed by DAO voting. The best
learners get funded to go further — no gatekeepers, no bureaucracy, just proof
of effort and community belief.

LearnVault is designed specifically with African learners in mind — a generation
of ambitious builders who have the talent and drive but lack access to the
financial resources that would take their skills to the next level. By combining
blockchain-powered credentials, on-chain reputation, and decentralized
scholarship funding, LearnVault creates a self-sustaining education ecosystem
that rewards effort and amplifies potential.

---

## Problem Statement

Access to quality tech education across Africa is not limited by lack of
ambition — it is limited by lack of opportunity. Three core problems define the
gap:

**Funding Barriers** — Bootcamps, courses, and developer tools cost money that
most learners in emerging markets simply do not have. Scholarship systems that
exist are slow, opaque, and often inaccessible.

**Credential Trust Gap** — Traditional certificates are easy to fake and hard to
verify. Employers and DAOs have no reliable way to assess a candidate's real
on-chain track record.

**Broken Incentive Systems** — Existing learn-to-earn platforms flood learners
with worthless tokens for clicking through slides. There is no real connection
between learning effort and financial reward.

LearnVault addresses all three problems in a single, cohesive platform.

---

## Solution

LearnVault creates a three-pillar ecosystem:

**1. Learn** — Learners enroll in skill tracks covering Web3 development, smart
contract engineering, DeFi, frontend development, and more. Every verified
milestone they complete earns them LearnTokens — soulbound, non-transferable
reputation tokens that live on-chain.

**2. Earn** — LearnTokens are proof of real effort. They unlock governance
rights, scholarship eligibility, and platform reputation. High-achieving
learners convert a portion of their LearnTokens into Governance Tokens, giving
them a voice in the DAO.

**3. Get Funded** — Learners with sufficient on-chain reputation can submit
scholarship proposals to the community treasury. Governance token holders vote
on proposals. Approved scholars receive milestone-based disbursements in
stablecoins — real, stable value delivered directly to their wallets.

## Smart Contract System

LearnVault is powered by six core smart contracts:

### `LearnToken.sol`

A **soulbound ERC20** token that is minted to learners upon verified milestone
completion. Non-transferable by design — it represents real effort, not
speculation. Your LearnToken balance is your on-chain academic reputation score.

### `GovernanceToken.sol`

A **transferable ERC20** distributed to donors upon treasury contribution and
earned by top learners at milestone thresholds. Used exclusively for DAO voting
on scholarship proposals.

### `CourseMilestone.sol`

Tracks learner progress per course. Each course has defined checkpoints verified
by a trusted multi-sig validator (transitioning to oracle-based verification in
V2). On successful verification, this contract triggers LearnToken minting.

### `ScholarshipTreasury.sol`

Holds all donor funds in stablecoins (USDC). Funds can only be released upon
successful proposal execution through the governance system. Tracks total
contributions per donor. Transparent and auditable by anyone.

### `MilestoneEscrow.sol`

Manages approved scholarship disbursements in tranches. Funds are released as
scholars hit agreed milestones. If a scholar is inactive for 30 days, unspent
funds automatically return to the treasury.

### `ScholarNFT.sol`

Mints a **soulbound ERC721 credential** to scholars who complete their funded
programs. Non-transferable, tamper-proof, and permanently verifiable on-chain.
Shareable with employers, DAOs, and the broader ecosystem.

## The Earn Loop

LearnVault's flywheel is designed so that effort compounds over time:
```

       │
       ▼

```

The more you learn, the more power and opportunity you unlock. Wealth is not the
barrier — effort is the currency.

## Scholarship DAO

The Scholarship DAO is the heart of LearnVault's funding mechanism.

### Eligibility to Apply

A learner must hold a minimum LearnToken balance (set by governance) before
submitting a proposal. This ensures only learners with a verified track record
can access treasury funds.

### Proposal Contents

Each scholarship proposal includes:

- Learning goal and intended program or bootcamp
- Amount requested in USDC
- Timeline and milestone plan
- On-chain reputation score (LRN balance)
- Wallet address for disbursement

### Voting

Governance token holders vote YES or NO within a 7-day window. A proposal passes
if it meets the required quorum and approval threshold. Failed proposals can be
resubmitted after 30 days.

### Disbursement

Approved funds are locked in `MilestoneEscrow.sol` and released in tranches as
the scholar completes agreed milestones. Progress is reported by the scholar and
confirmed by a community-elected validator committee (transitioning to oracle
verification in V2).

### Accountability

Scholars who abandon funded programs without communication are flagged on-chain.
Repeated abandonment affects future proposal eligibility. Unspent funds always
return to the treasury.

---

## Governance

LearnVault's DAO governance covers:

- Scholarship eligibility thresholds (minimum LRN to apply)
- Voting quorum and approval thresholds
- Treasury allocation limits per proposal
- Adding new course tracks to the platform
- Protocol upgrades and parameter changes

Governance evolves over time. In V1, the founding team holds a multi-sig with
community governance as an advisory layer. In V2, full on-chain governance
transfers to token holders.

## Whitepaper Generation

The LearnVault Technical Whitepaper is authored in Markdown and exported to PDF.
To ensure Mermaid diagrams render correctly in the PDF export, follow this
two-step build process:

1. **Compile Diagrams to Images:** Generate static PNGs from the Mermaid source
   files using the Mermaid CLI:

   ```bash
   npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i docs/architecture.mmd -o docs/architecture.png
```

2. **Generate the PDF:** Once the diagrams are compiled and embedded as standard
   markdown image links, generate the final PDF using `md-to-pdf`:
   ```bash
   npx md-to-pdf docs/whitepaper.md
```

---

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Install cargo-watch for watch mode:
```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test                 # runs all Soroban contract tests
npm run test:contracts   # alias for the above
npm run test:watch       # re-runs tests on file changes
```
